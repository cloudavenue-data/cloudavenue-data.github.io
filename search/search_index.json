This is a common issue when teams don\u2019t communicate effectively, leading to disruptions across the data stack. Troubleshooting and resolving these complex problems can take hours or even days. Cloud Avenue is an AI-powered platform designed to improve the integrity and resilience of your data pipelines by preventing issues before they occur rather than troubleshooting problems once they\u2019re in production. Acting as an early warning system for your data pipelines, the platform offers fully automated, AI-driven proactive data lineage to track how data flows through your stack. It provides actionable insights into the impact of code changes across your entire stack. Importantly, it analyzes only metadata - not the data itself ensuring privacy and security. Cloud Avenue seamlessly integrates with a wide range of popular tools, including Fivetran, dbt, Looker, Node.js codebases, and Debezium. The platform delivers a detailed breakdown of how changes in application code impact downstream systems, helping data teams understand and address potential disruptions before they escalate. With built-in technical impact analysis, Cloud Avenue identifies functional dependencies and highlights where changes in your system might cause downstream disruptions. This proactive approach helps data teams detect and mitigate issues early in development, improving collaboration, reducing firefighting, and increasing efficiency. Cloud Avenue delivers measurable impact by minimizing downtime, accelerating development cycles, and boosting team productivity. Its automated insights reduce the need for manual troubleshooting, allowing your teams to focus on innovation rather than solving problems.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>After installing the app, it may take some time to initialize before you can view insights across your data stack. If you created a Cloud Avenue account, you will receive an email notification once the initialization is complete.
